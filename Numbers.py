apple = 10; # Not assigning variable a value will give error
banana = ""; # Incase want to just have a variable assign an empty string

print(5 + 2);
print(5 ** 2); # 5 power 2
print(20 / 15); # Division always gives floating
print(20 // 15); # Floor value of quotient

print(4 * 3.1 + 2); # Output --> 14.4 Division & Multiplication have higher precedence
# 1st 4 times 3.1 then plus 2 in that value

# Parantheses have the highest precedence which helps to evaluate that expression as whole
# Example :
print(4 * (3.1 + 2)) # Output --> 20.4 We can wrap an expression in parantheses
# 1st 3.1 + 2 got computed then multiplied by 4
